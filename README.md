##  This [website](https://rocket-elevators.ca) used the following:

-   [HTML5](https://html.com/html5/)
-   [CSS](https://css-tricks.com/)
-   [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

It was then transformed into a Ruby on Rails app. 

Check out [this repo](https://github.com/ArtificialSoda/RocketElevators-Serverless-NodeJS) to see the code for the serverside script which was made with NodeJS' Express framework!
